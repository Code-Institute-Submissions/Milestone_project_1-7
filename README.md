# Milestone Project 1
## Pulze Gaming League Responsive Website Project 
### Background 
This Milestone project creation is the last step of learning and study from the first three modules of the Full Stack Developer Course, HTML, CSS & User Centric Frontend Development, to build a mobile-first fully responsive website. In this case for the fictional company "Pulze". 

![alt text](https://github.com/Gonzo2500/Milestone_project_1/blob/master/documentation/screenshots/screenshot-hero.PNG "Hero-shot index.html")

The Website provides the user with the ability to look for tournaments, sign up for a specific day, region and game.

### Functionality 
The project uses the Bootstrap Framework combined with flex to create a multi-page fully responsive, Desktop-First approach Website. It is completely within the scope of the guidelines of the milestone requirements and does not use any back-end functions or  any custom javascript. With that in mind please note that although this website contains "forms" i.e. modals on the event.html and a contact form on contact.html they do not alert anyone that a sign up has been created and will not populate any server database.

Both forms hold data validation and all fields residing within are set to required ensuring information submitted is of the correct format.

The fonts used throughout the site were imported into the HTML of each page from Google Fonts and are called 'Roboto' and "Press Start 2p".

As described above, this project went outside the original brief and is based on the needs of a real-life local company and will be used to fulfill a considerable gap in their entry stake into the marketplace. Given this, the functionality of the website will evolve over time to incorporate a Merchandise store, interactive Video Tours, and Online bookings & payments

##### Typography
The Roboto font is the main font used in this project. It provides a natural reading rhythm giving the webpage a nice look while also bringing accessibility in terms of easy to read text. As a Fallback Sans-serif was used, in case the font doesn't load to the webpage correctly.

Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco arcade games. It was used mostly for headers. It gives the webpage an arcade feeling, which suits the theme "gaming" perfectly. The reason for the scarce usage of this font was to keep the easy readable. As a Fallback Sans-serif was used, in case the font doesn't load to the webpage correctly.

##### Imagery
Images for the hero shots were used to create a striking effect that gains the users/visitors attention. Game logos were used to show what kind of games are offered on the webage.
